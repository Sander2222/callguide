**Description**

If you have an ingame whitelist on your server, this is a perfect script for you. If a player spawns in the whiteliste ingame and no teammember is at the whitelist, the player just can go to an NPC and send a notify to all teammembers online. You have a good and understandable config for translation and add/remove groups for the notify. For more information just put this script on the server and adjust the config for your wishes.
